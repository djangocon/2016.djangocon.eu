Did you know that Budapest is a city of ruin pubs?
They're a major attraction in the Budapest nightlife and their unique ambiance is something you should experience at least once.


Thanks to the generosity of our partner and party sponsor [Nephila](https://www.nephila.it/en/), we managed to book one of the best ruin pubs in Budapest just for ourselves. Bring your conference badge and your best outfit and join us on Thursday, March 31st around 9pm for a night you won't soon forget.


Conference attendees will get a free drink coupon valid for a variety of beverages (both with and without alcohol).

* 9.30pm - Live music: Barbara Stahl
* 2.00pm - Doors close, time to go to bed

**About EXTRA**:
