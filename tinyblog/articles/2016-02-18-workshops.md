# Workshops and Sprints 🔨🏃🎷

> Published on 18th Feb 2016 by Baptiste Mispelon

We've just announced the venue for the workshops and sprints and you won't believe what's going to happen next...

---

Have you ever been to a conference or look at its program and wished there was more?

**Well there is!**

At DjangoCon, the [three days of talks](/speakers/schedule/) are only half the fun: there are also two days of workshops and sprints!

This year, we'll be holding our traditional post-conference workshops and sprints at a place called [MÜSZI](/venue/#workshops) on April 2nd and 3rd (Saturday & Sunday).


Come and learn about how to contribute to Django (sprints 🏃),
get some help on a project you're working on (clinics 🏥),
discover cool new things to do with Django (workshops 🔨),
or simply hang out with fellow Django enthusiasts around a drink, a snack, or a game of cards.

We give you the space, the electricity, and the internet; you bring the magic ✨!


And the best part? We're still [taking proposals](/cfp/workshop/) for workshops! So if you have an idea for a workshop you want to organize during those two days, tell us about it and we'll do our best to provide you with everything you need for it.



See you in Budapest! 🎷
