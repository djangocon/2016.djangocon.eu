# DjangoCon Europe 5k run

> Published on 30th Mar 2016 by Tomáš Ehrlich

The conference is almost here and we're all super excited about it! 
5 days of programming, networking and mostly fun.

Let's gather together in the morning, before the conference, to
get a shot of pure oxygen! 
The beautiful Margaret Island (Margitsziget) is only 3 km or 15 mins from the venue.

We can meet on **31th March, at 7:00** near the **Margitsziget** 
bus station (on the island).

There is a [running track](https://www.strava.com/segments/1056549) around the island. 
It's only 5 km long, so we can all enjoy 
it at a very peaceful pace and still get to the conference on time.
 
Looking forward to meet you all!
