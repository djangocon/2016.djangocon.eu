# DjangoCon Europe 5k run

> Published on 28th Mar 2016 by Tomáš Ehrlich

The confrence is almost here and we're all super excited about it! 
5 days of programming, networking and mostly fun.

Let's gather together in the morning, before the conference to
get a shot of pure oxygen! There is a beatiful Margaret Island 
(Margitsziget) with even more beautiful park only 3 km or 15 mins
from the venue. 

We can meet on **31th March, at 7:00** near the **Margitsziget** 
bus station (on the island).

There is a [5 km long route](https://www.strava.com/segments/1056549) around the island,
so we can all enjoy it at very peaceful pace.
 
Looking forward to meet you all!
