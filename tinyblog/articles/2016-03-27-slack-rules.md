# Attendees Slack channel etiquette

> Published on 27th Mar 2016 by Ola Sitarska

DjangoCon is in three days! Yay! Excitement! No stressful at all!

As we're coming closer to the DjangoCon Europe, our attendees Slack channel gets
busier. We hope it's going to be a valuable source of information and will make it
easier to communicate with your fellow attendees.

To make the experience comfortable for everyone, we thought it'd be useful to
outline a set of clear expectations for all participants in the Slack channel.

1. Slack channel is no exception to conference [Code of Conduct](/coc/). We expect you
to comply with the Code of Conduct while communicating via Slack channel too.
2. Do not message people privately without their consent, and do not invite them
to join any room without their consent.
3. Don't mention people who don't belong to particular room in that room.

If at any time you're feeling uncomfortable due to anyone's behaviour on the Slack
channel, please contact the organizers by emailing [2016@djangocon.eu](mailto:2016@djangocon.eu),
approaching them at the conference, or contacting @organizers on Slack.

See you in Budapest really soon!
